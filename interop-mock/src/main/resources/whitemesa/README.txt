The request/response messages in this folder have been designed to make the
WhiteMesaSoap12AddTestSvcTestCase in Axis 1.4 pass (the original endpoint at
www.whitemesa.net is no longer available). Note that they are not compatible with the messages
specified in http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-soap12-testcollection-20070427/ because the
whitemesa endpoint used doc/lit, while the W3C messages use rpc/encoded.
